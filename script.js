            aboutText: `Sanatan Dharma, often translated as the "Eternal Religion," is the indigenous name for Hinduism. It signifies a timeless, universal set of principles and truths. It is not founded by a single person but is a result of the collective wisdom of ancient sages and seers. Key concepts include Dharma (righteous conduct), Karma (the law of cause and effect), Samsara (the cycle of birth, death, and reincarnation), and Moksha (liberation from the cycle).`,
